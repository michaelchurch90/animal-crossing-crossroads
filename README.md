# Crossroads: Animal Crossing Tracker

## Introduction
There are many things to do in Animal Crossing: New Horizons for the Nintendo Switch. Crossraods helps people track and complete their progress in the game. I am starting with tacking fishing progress, but will look to expand to bugs, art, and potentially other areas of the game. 

Crossroads is backed by the [ACNH API](http://acnhapi.com/). I would like to give a special thanks to the developers of this api as they have made it so I can soley focus on working on my front end development.


## Other Animal Crossing Trackers
There are already a number of other Animal Crossing trackers and helpers. If you would like a more complete tracker I would suggest [AC Helper](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1508764244). This app is much more feature complete than my website.

Some of the reasons I decided to build this app when others exists are:
1. Work on my front end development (I am primarily a backend Java dev)
1. I have some ideas on ways to organize tracking of the critters that is different than what I have already seen.
1. Pet projects are fun! I usually develop them only on my computer and don't end up deploying them to "prod".


## TODO
1. Clean site style - Good website design is not my strengths. I'm looking to practice this, so feel free to offer advice and suggestions
1. Work on grouping
   * Group critters by time and date.
   * Currently available critters show up first. 
1. Persist state
   * Use local storage to keep track of what the user has completed.
   * Use Service workers to make the website work offline
1. Add critter page
1. Add art page

If you would like to contact me for ideas or if you would like to contribute. Just email me at michaelchurch90+dev@gmail.com. If you send an email without dev on the end it has a higher chance of being missed.
